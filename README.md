# Java Pattern Problems

This project contains a collection of Java programs for various pattern printing problems. Each pattern is implemented in a separate file, organized in the `Day6` and `Patterns` folders.

## Folders

- **Day6**: Contains initial pattern problems and solutions.
- **Patterns**: Contains a wide variety of pattern programs, each in its own Java file.

## How to Run

1. Open any `.java` file in your IDE or editor.
2. Compile and run the file. Some programs use a fixed value for `n`, while others may prompt for user input.

## Patterns Included
- Solid squares and rectangles
- Left/right/inverted triangles
- Number triangles and sequences
- Centered and reverse-centered patterns
- Pyramids and inverse pyramids
- Hollow squares, X, and plus patterns
- Binary chessboard
- Special number patterns

Feel free to explore and use these files for learning or practice!
